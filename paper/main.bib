  abstract = {Summary             This article addresses the problem of maneuvering multiple agents that must visit a number of target sets, while enforcing connectivity constraints and avoiding obstacle as well as interagent collisions. The tool to cope with the problem is a formulation of model predictive control including binary decision variables. In this regard, two mixed-integer linear programming formulations are presented, considering a trade-off between optimality and scalability between them. Simulation results are also shown to illustrate the main features of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract = {This work is concerned with the problem of planning trajectories and assigning tasks for a Multi-Agent System (MAS) comprised of differential drive robots. We propose a multirate hierarchical control structure that employs a planner based on robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) with mixed-integer programming (MIP) encoding. The planner computes trajectories and assigns tasks for each element of the group in real-time, while also guaranteeing the communication network of the MAS to be robustly connected at all times. Additionally, we provide a data-based methodology to estimate the disturbances sets required by the robust MPC formulation. The results are demonstrated with experiments in two obstacle-filled scenarios},

We approach this field from two perspectives: of robotic applications that                 need                 communication capabilities in order to accomplish tasks, and of networking technologies that have enabled newer and more advanced multi-robot systems.                                                        Recent Findings               Through this review, we identify a dearth of work that holistically tackles the problem of co-design and co-optimization of robots and the networks they employ. We also highlight the role that data-driven and machine learning approaches play in evolving communication pipelines for multi-robot systems. In particular, we refer to recent work that diverges from hand-designed communication patterns, and also discuss the ``sim-to-real'' gap in this context.                                         Summary                                We present a critical view of the way robotic algorithms and their networking systems have evolved, and make the case for a more synergistic approach. Finally, we also identify four broad                 Open Problems                 for research and development, while offering a data-driven perspective for solving some of them.},
